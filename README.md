## Getting Started
To test these calculators, follow the instructions for each language:

### C++
1. Navigate to the `cpp` directory.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler, e.g., `g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator`.
3. Run the executable, e.g., `./calculator`.

### Python
1. Navigate to the `python` directory.
2. Run the script using Python, e.g., `python calculator.py`.

### Java (Swing)
1. Navigate to the `java` directory.
2. Compile the code using `javac`, e.g., `javac Calculator.java`.
3. Run the application, e.g., `java Calculator`.

### JavaScript
1. Navigate to the `javascript` directory.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute a calculator implementation in a different programming language or improve an existing one, please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature, e.g., `git checkout -b add-new-calculator`.
3. Add your code in a new directory named after the programming language.
4. Commit your changes and push to your fork.
5. Create a pull request with a description of your changes.

We welcome all contributions and improvements!
